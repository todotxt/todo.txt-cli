todo.sh tests
=============

This directory holds test scripts for todo.sh.  The
first part of this short document describes how to run the tests
and read their output.

When fixing the tools or adding enhancements, you are strongly
encouraged to add tests in this directory to cover what you are
trying to fix or enhance.  The later part of this short document
describes how your test scripts should be organized.


Running Tests
-------------

The easiest way to run tests is to say "make test" from the top-level.
This runs all the tests.

    rm -rf tests/test-results "tests/trash directory"*
    cd tests && sh t0000-config.sh 
    *   ok 1: no config file
    *   ok 2: config file (default location 1)
    *   ok 3: config file (default location 2)
    *   ok 4: config file (command line)
    *   ok 5: config file (env variable)
    * passed all 5 test(s)
    cd tests && sh t0001-null.sh 
    *   ok 1: null ls
    * passed all 1 test(s)
    rm -rf tests/test-results

Or you can run each test individually from command line, like
this:

    $ ./t0001-null.sh 
    *   ok 1: null ls
    * passed all 1 test(s)

You can pass --verbose (or -v), --debug (or -d), and --immediate
(or -i) command line argument to the test, or by setting GIT_TEST_OPTS
appropriately before running "make".

--verbose::
	This makes the test more verbose.  Specifically, the
	command being run and their output if any are also
	output.

--debug::
	This may help the person who is developing a new test.
	It causes the command defined with test_debug to run.

--immediate::
	This causes the test to immediately exit upon the first
	failed test.

--long-tests::
	This causes additional long-running tests to be run (where
	available), for more exhaustive testing.

--tee::
	In addition to printing the test output to the terminal,
	write it to files named 't/test-results/$TEST_NAME.out'.
	As the names depend on the tests' file names, it is safe to
	run the tests with this option in parallel.

Skipping Tests
--------------

In some environments, certain tests have no way of succeeding
due to platform limitation, such as lack of 'unzip' program, or
filesystem that do not allow arbitrary sequence of non-NUL bytes
as pathnames.

You should be able to say something like

    $ SKIP_TESTS=t0000.2 sh ./t0000-config.sh

and even:

    $ SKIP_TESTS='t[0-4]??? t91?? t9200.8' make

to omit such tests.  The value of the environment variable is a
SP separated list of patterns that tells which tests to skip,
and either can match the "t[0-9]{4}" part to skip the whole
test, or t[0-9]{4} followed by ".$number" to say which
particular test to skip.

Note that some tests in the existing test suite rely on previous
test item, so you cannot arbitrarily disable one and expect the
remainder of test to check what the test originally was intended
to check.


Naming Tests
------------

The test files are named as:

	tNNNN-commandname-details.sh

where N is a decimal digit.

First digit tells the family:

	0 - the absolute basics and global stuff
	1 - basic every-day usage
	2 - add ins

Second digit tells the particular command we are testing.

Third digit (optionally) tells the particular switch or group of switches
we are testing.

If you create files under tests/ directory (i.e. here) that is not
the top-level test script, never name the file to match the above
pattern.  The Makefile here considers all such files as the
top-level test script and tries to run all of them.  A care is
especially needed if you are creating a common test library
file, similar to test-lib.sh, because such a library file may
not be suitable for standalone execution.


Writing Tests
-------------

The test script is written as a shell script.  It should start
with the standard "#!/bin/sh" with copyright notices, and an
assignment to variable 'test_description', like this:

	#!/bin/sh
	#
	# Copyright (c) 2005 Junio C Hamano
	#

	test_description='xxx test (option --frotz)

	This test registers the following structure in the cache
	and tries to run git-ls-files with option --frotz.'


Source 'test-lib.sh'
--------------------

After assigning test_description, the test script should source
test-lib.sh like this:

	. ./test-lib.sh

This test harness library does the following things:

 - If the script is invoked with command line argument --help
   (or -h), it shows the test_description and exits.

 - Creates an empty test directory with an empty todo file
   database and chdir(2) into it.  This directory is 't/trash directory'
   if you must know, but I do not think you care.

 - Defines standard test helper functions for your scripts to
   use.  These functions are designed to make all scripts behave
   consistently when command line arguments --verbose (or -v),
   --debug (or -d), and --immediate (or -i) is given.


End with test_done
------------------

Your script will be a sequence of tests, using helper functions
from the test harness library.  At the end of the script, call
'test_done'.


Test harness library
--------------------

There are a handful helper functions defined in the test harness
library for your script to use.

 - test_todo_session <message> < transcript

   This takes a single string as a parameter, which is treated
   as a base description of what is being tested, and then
   reads from standard input a transcript of todo.sh commands
   and expected output.  Each command is run in the current
   test environment and the output is compared with the
   expected output.  (See below for how to generate transcripts
   easily.)

 - test_tick [interval]

   The test harness has an internal view of time which is
   implemented by wrapping the date command.  This takes a single
   optional positive integer parameter which indicates how much
   to advance the internal time.  The default value is one day.

 - test_expect_success <message> <script>

   This takes two strings as parameter, and evaluates the
   <script>.  If it yields success, test is considered
   successful.  <message> should state what it is testing.

   Example:

	test_expect_success \
	    'git-write-tree should be able to write an empty tree.' \
	    'tree=$(git-write-tree)'

 - test_expect_failure <message> <script>

   This is NOT the opposite of test_expect_success, but is used
   to mark a test that demonstrates a known breakage.  Unlike
   the usual test_expect_success tests, which say "ok" on
   success and "FAIL" on failure, this will say "FIXED" on
   success and "still broken" on failure.  Failures from these
   tests won't cause -i (immediate) to stop.

 - test_debug <script>

   This takes a single argument, <script>, and evaluates it only
   when the test script is started with --debug command line
   argument.  This is primarily meant for use during the
   development of a new test script.

 - test_done

   Your test script must have test_done at the end.  Its purpose
   is to summarize successes and failures in the test script and
   exit with an appropriate error code.


Generating test transcripts
---------------------------

You can generate test scripts from screenshots as following:

    $ ./testshell.sh

You'll be in a special test environment with an empty todo.txt
and the dates and timestamps will be artificially fixed.

Then the session can be used to make a unit test thanks to
test_todo_session, see the existing tests as examples.

Be careful to replace all occurences of the full path to the test
directory by $HOME as testshell.sh will explain you when you execute it
otherwise the tests will work properly only on your own computer.

Don't use "script" as this would log every keystroke, not only what's
visible!!
