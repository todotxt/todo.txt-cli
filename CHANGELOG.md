### Changed

- Improve code commenting/documentation.
- Refactor code for speed/better organization.
- Improve test coverage and test library.

### Removed

- Removed add date from line completion, ie, `todo.sh ls 10[tab]`.

### Fixed

- Properly replace date when replacing task with priority and date.
- Handle `-h`, `shorthelp`, and `help` when a Fatal Error happens.
- Fix `todo_completion` problem with Bash 3.1.

## [2.9.0] - 2012-04-08

### Added

- Added tab auto-completion of projects and contexts from `todo.txt` and `done.txt`. Type `@<Tab>` or `+<Tab>` while entering a task.
- Added new listaddons command displays installed addons.
- List priorities within a range using listpri. For example, to see tasks prioritized A-B, use `todo.sh listpri A-B`

### Fixed

- Fixed various cosmetic issues, bugs, and added developer test library enhancements.

## [2.8.0] - 2011-09-13

### Added

- `listpri`/`lsp` now filters by term. For example, `todo.sh lsp A book` will only return tasks prioritized `A` with the word book in them.
- Added support for todo directory paths with spaces in them.
- Tasks with priority included and auto prepend date on (`-t`) get the date where expected.
- Smarter action completion messaging: `do`, `pri`, and `depri` all let you know if a task is already done, prioritized, or deprioritized.
- Made more parameters available to offer more control to custom actions (`-c`, `-A`, `-N`, `-T`)

### Changed

- Improved portability for Dropbox or USB key users. If not specified, todo.sh checks for a config file in its own directory; default todo.txt location is todo.sh's directory.
- Improved script performance thanks to optimized code
- Exposed `cleaninput()` for use in addons
- Improved testing framework:
  - Better escaped input handling
  - Abstracted make_action function to test custom action behavior
  - Added tests for source code compliance
  - Cleaner, simpler, modernized, optimized code

### Fixed

- Custom action output no longer prefaced by `TODO:` so it's easier to see when the core script vs. addon is performing an action
- `listpri` complains if specified priority is invalid
- Don't abort task listing when items contain certain escape sequences (`\c \033`)
- Condense whitespace ONLY whe task is quoted; automatically convert CRLF to space
- Don't delete `|` (pipe) from task input
- `-+` and `-@` no longer break task coloring if context or project appears at the end of the line

## [2.7.0] - 2010-08-03

### Added

- Added generalization of the _PRI_X_ color support to all priorities
- Added highlighting of done, but not yet archived tasks via _COLOR_DONE_
- Color map (BLACK, ...) now supports spaces in the color definitions, making it possible to override the default ANSI escape codes with e.g. Conky tags (`${color black}`)

### Changed

- Cleanup: help messages, consistent output messages
- Exporting `die()` function for use in custom commands
- `prepend` and `replace` actions keep prepended date, `append` considers sentence delimiters
- Tests: several regression tests added

## [2.6.0] - 2010-05-11

### Added

- Added a case for the fixed replace command.

### Changed

- Changed odd tabs to spaces.
- Faster help/usage document outputs.
- Consolidated `TODOTXT_VERBOSE` tests.
- Refactored various add functionality to one function.
- Updated `_list()` output to match updated `addto`.

### Fixed

- Quoting regexp to parse properly.
- Fixed erroneous hide/show comments.
- Correctly fixed regexp quoting issue for bash v3.1.x and v3.2.x.
- Old versions of bash do not have `=~`
- Fix line endings.
- Fixed bug for replace command.

## [2.5.0] - 2010-05-05

### Added

- Support use of `$HOME/.todo/` for all todo.sh configuration
- Added new multiple do capability to help message

- Added a new variable `$TODO_FULL_SH`
- Added new action `addm`
- Added support PAGER pipe for help output
- Added some additional mappings, plus a project context

### Changed

- Added 'silent' to a bunch of calls

### Fixed

- Fixing prepend and priority issue.
- Replace with `priority` set
- Multiple `do` items
- `prepend` not correct on prioritized tasks
- Invalid date range. Changed regex `[ -~]` to `[ ~-]`.
- `do`: no safeguard to `do` twice. Tests item is not marked done before attempting to mark item as "done".
- Fixed `add` does not escape line breaks
- `append` and `replace` unexpected behavior if there's an `&` in task (even in quotes)
- Tasks whose `ID` begins with `0` ought to be ignored.
- Fixed auto-complete function name for contexts

## [2.4.0] - 2009-05-11

### Added

- Added support for `TODOTXT_FINAL_FILTER` to provide a final custom list filter.
- Added support for custom sorting (can set in `todo.cfg`)
- Added parameterize for `.todo.actions.d` directory

### Removed

- Removed annoying trailing space on `pri` tasks
- Don't set colors in default `todo.cfg`.

### Fixed

- `listcon` and `listproj` now work correctly on Mac OS X 10.5

- Support commands combination for `TODOTXT_SORT_COMMAND`; e.g. piped commands can be used: `export TODOTXT_SORT_COMMAND=" env LC_COLLATE=C sort -f -k2 - | grep -m 10 ."`
- Replace now echoes old item AND new item, like it used to.
- `depri` no longer wipes out tasks with more than just the priority in parentheses
- Now throws an error if you try to prioritize with more than one letter, ie, `todo.sh pri AA` doesn't work any more.

## [2.3.0] - 2009-04-02

### Added

- Added hide priority, context, and projects options now enabled `-P`, `-@` and `-+`

- Added Makefile dist infrastructure for versioned releases in Downloads area on GitHub

### Changed

- Separated `_list` function for reuse by various versions of list command to reduce duplicate code
- Set `ls` as the default action

## [2.2.0] - 2009-03-??

### Fixed

- For awhile here during the GitHub transition, we stripped the version number from todo.sh and updated it kind of willy-nilly, so we're back-versioning all unversioned copies v 2.2.

## [2.1.0] - 2009-02-23

### Added

- Added "pluggability" with `~/.todo.actions.d/` support (via [Tammy and Ed](http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/todotxt/message/1739))
- Added `-t` param, off by default. When specified, it automatically prepends the current date to new todo's on add
- Searches for more Unix-y `~/.todo.cfg` if `~/todo.cfg` doesn't exist (via [Ed](http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/todotxt/message/1767))

### Fixed

- Corrected "ambiguous redirect" bug with done file (via [Jeff](http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/todotxt/message/1764))
- Corrected usage and help message with new params
- Corrected config file miscomment about colors

## [2.0.1] - 2009-02-17

### Fixed

- Restored `-d` parameter functionality broken in 2.0 (d'oh, thanks Jason, you made the changelog! )

## [2.0.0] - 2009-02-17

### Added

- Added `addto [DEST] "Text to add"` will append text to any file in the todo directory, like `ideas.txt` or `maybelater.txt`.
- Added `mv # [DEST]` will move a task from `todo.txt` to another file `[DEST]` in the todo directory, like if you decide your `"Learn French"` task should go into your `maybelater.txt` file.
- `depri #` removes priority from a task.
- `rm # [TERM]` or `del # [TERM]` will delete just the `[TERM]` from the task on line # in todo.txt.
- `listfile [SRC] [TERM]` or `lf [SRC] [TERM]` will list the contents of any text file in the todo directory, and filter by keyword `[TERM]`.
- `listcon` (`lsc`) and `listproj` (`lsprj`) lists contexts and projects, respectively, that appear in todo.txt. (Requires `gawk`)
- On task deletion, line number preservation is on by default (known issue, leaves blank lines). Optional, can be turned off with `-n` option.
- Auto-archive on task completion is now on by default; can be turned off with `-a` parameter.

### Changed

- Separated config file into a non hidden dot file.

### Fixed

- Better error handling throughout for all commands.

  Update:

### Fixed

- Actions are now case-insensitive (ie, `todo.sh Add` will work)

## [1.7.1] - 2006-07-21

### Changed

- Action `listall` displays tasks from both todo.txt and done.txt

## [1.5.2] - 2006-06-26

### Fixed

- Items that start with `x ` (an x with a space after) are archived now to avoid lines that start with a word like `xander` from being archived. (tx, Tannie!)
